# ðŸ’Ž Diamond Data Analysis

This project is part of the **Kunskapskontroll: Python AI Course** assignment at NBI Academy.

## ðŸ“š Assignment Overview

This knowledge test consists of two parts:

1. **Theory and Python exercises** â€“ covering classes, lists, tuples, functions, and basic algorithms.
2. **Data analysis with Python** â€“ analyzing a real dataset (`diamonds.csv`) and presenting results in a `Streamlit` app.

> Full instructions available in `kunskapskontroll_python_ai.pdf`.

## Streamlit App

A `Streamlit` application is included to visualize the diamond data using:
- UMAP cluster projections
- Feature analysis by price, cut, color, clarity

Launch with:
```bash
cd '.\Del 2 - Dataanalys i Python\'
streamlit run Streamlit/main.py
